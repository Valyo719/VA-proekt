			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>With a potent 401-hp turbocharged five-cylinder engine, the 2022 Audi RS3 is the raciest version of the
				company's
				small luxury sedan. Based on the four-door Audi A3 and the sportier S3–but blessed with even more power
				and
				enhanced chassis tuning–the new RS variant challenges hi-po rivals such as the BMW M2 coupe and
				Mercedes-AMG
				CLA45 sedan. However, the RS3's unusual engine gives it one of the most distinct soundtracks in its
				class. The
				Audi's sharply creased sheetmetal as well as its stylish, nicely appointed interior help it appeal to
				audiences
				who appreciate sportiness as much as luxuriousness.</p>

			<h2>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h2>
			<p>One of the most distinct elements of the RS3 is its unusual five-cylinder engine. Its odd number of
				cylinders
				gives it a unique thrumming soundtrack that was particularly pleasing on the outgoing model. The latest
				iteration is again a turbocharged 2.5-liter, but it now makes 401 horsepower­. The engine pairs with a
				seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that deliberately downshifts with slight throttle inputs,
				but it
				behaves less aggressively during hard braking. Its standard all-wheel-drive system includes a
				torque-vectoring
				rear differential with a drift mode.</p>
			<p>Compared with the lesser A3 and S3, the sportiest 3 has upgraded brakes, a stiffer suspension setup, and
				a unique
				set of wheels on stickier performance tires.Plus, it was composed and comfortable when driven sedately
				on
				regular roads.</p>

			<h2>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h2>
			<p>Inside, the RS3's passenger space is identical to the A3 and S3, but it has a set of more aggressively
				bolstered
				front seats. Audi endows all versions with a dashboard that looks anything but bland. A pair of
				high-mounted air
				vents face the driver and flank the instrument panel binnacle that houses a set of digital gauges. The
				RS3 is
				also available with a heads-up display. Below the center touchscreen are climate controls with physical
				buttons,
				and there's a bin below them that's integrated into the center console. Unfortunately, drivers have to
				select
				gears via a weird, stubby shifter; paddles on the steering wheel are an alternative once the RS3 is in
				motion.
