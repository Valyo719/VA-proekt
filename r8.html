		<h1>2023 Audi R8 GT Is a Playful, Traction-Limited Goodbye</h1>
		<p>The 602-hp GT is the most powerful rear-drive Audi ever and a final sendoff to the mid-engine R8.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>The last V10</h2>
	<p>Well, this is finally the end. Both for Audi's 5.2-liter V-10 screamer—and V-10s in general—as well as its
		mid-engine R8 supercar. It seems 2023 is the last model year, and this limited-edition R8 GT, which lives among
		the rest of the R8 coupe and spyder lineup, the last variant.</p>
	<img height=250 src="snimki/r8-1.jpg">
	<h2>What’s Special about the Special Edition</h2>
	<p>There will only be 333 special-edition R8 GT RWD coupes available, distinguishable from other R8s through black
		badges including a new R8 GT emblem. For wind-tunnel-tested stability and increased car-show cred, the GT comes
		with a glossy carbon-fiber front splitter, side spats, rear scoops, a diffuser, and a high gooseneck rear wing.
	</p>
	<p>The GT's $253,290 price may seem expensive, as it's $91,895 more than a regular 2023 rear-drive R8 coupe. But
		after checking all the option boxes that are included on the GT, the premium drops to $53,900.</p>
	<p>Not only are the badges and aero elements menacingly midnighted, but should you peer through the rear hatch at
		the V-10 engine, even the intake manifold on the GT is black. Basically, it looks like the ZL1 1LE of R8s.</p>
	<img height=300 src="snimki/r8-e.jpg">
	<h2>Interior</h2>
	<p>Inside, it reflects the first-generation R8 GT with a black and red interior, including red seatbelts. Floor mats
		and seats declare the GT’s special status, and owners can figure out their place in the order line with a
		sequential special edition build number embedded in the carbon-fiber center console.</p>
