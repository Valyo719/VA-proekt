			<h1>2020 Audi RS7 Enthralls with Dynamite Looks and Big Power</h1>
				<h3>Starting at $122 995</h3>
<p>Audi’s glorious 4.0-liter V-8 makes for a delightful pairing with the elegant A7 Sportback.</p>

			<h2>HIGHS: Fetching design, glorious V-8, fluid handling.</h2>
				<p>The new RS7 is a wonderfully well-rounded, highly desirable sport-luxury hatchback. The impressive upgrades present in the RS model make up for many deficiencies, starting with its shape. On the road, the RS7 looks stunning. Thanks to a 1.7-inch-wider body, the stance is menacing, especially on the optional 22-inch wheels. The details—such as larger air intakes, a pop-up rear spoiler, and RS badging—are just short of overwrought. It’s a showstopper.</p>

			<h2>Eight Is Great</h2>
				<p>Audi's luscious 4.0-liter V-8, which used to be found in both the S7 and RS7 models, is now reserved for the top-dog RS models only (the new S7 gets a twin-turbo V-6). We've long proclaimed this twin-turbo mill to be one of the great engines in existence, and it's gotten slightly better still for the new RS7. The turbos are bigger, and it's now paired with a 48-volt hybrid system that allows for a very aggressive stop-start strategy to save fuel.</p>
				<p>Totals of 591 horsepower, a conventional eight-speed automatic transmission paired with a real center differential send the torque to all four wheels. This is a hugely impressive amount of oomph, but the RS7 never feels bombastic, instead effortlessly building speed, making the RS7 easy to drive smoothly and very, very quickly.</p>

			<h2>LOWS: Fussy touchscreens, RS6 Avant is still more appealing.</h2>
				<p>Of the two suspension setups offered, Audi R&D chief Victor Underberg says he'd choose the greater range of adjustability brought by the standard air springs. They do indeed provide a cushy ride when in Comfort mode. But, at least on the fine pavement in Germany where we sampled the RS7, we loved the optional Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) setup, which will be offered in the States as a stand-alone option. In addition to lowering the RS7 0.2 inch, DRC consists of steel springs and adaptive dampers that are diagonally linked to assist in quelling roll and pitch. There's a noticeable uptick in firmness in the DRC car no matter which driving mode is selected, but we felt it was worth it for the extra measure of precision and feel it imparts in corners</p>
